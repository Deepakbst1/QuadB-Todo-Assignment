Description of Project:

The Basic To-Do Application is a simple yet functional task management tool developed using ReactJS, showcasing proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React components, hooks, and state management using Redux.

Frontend Development:

HTML Structure: The application's layout is structured using HTML, providing a solid foundation for user interaction and visual representation of tasks.
CSS Styling: CSS has been utilized to style the application, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. While CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI could have been employed for design components, custom styling has been implemented for a personalized touch.
JavaScript Logic: The application logic is implemented using JavaScript (ES6 or later), allowing for dynamic interaction and seamless task management.
React Components:

Functional Components: The application is developed using functional components, leveraging React's latest features and best practices for efficient and maintainable code.
React Hooks: React hooks such as useState and useEffect are employed throughout the application, enabling stateful logic and side effects within functional components.
TaskInput Component: A dedicated component, TaskInput, facilitates the addition of new tasks. Users can input task details into a text field and add them to the task list with ease.
TaskList Component: The TaskList component is responsible for displaying the list of tasks added by the user. Tasks are presented in a clear and concise format, ensuring optimal readability.
State Management:

Redux Integration: Redux is utilized to manage the application's state effectively. Tasks are stored in the Redux store, and state updates are handled seamlessly when adding or removing tasks.
Actions and Reducers: Actions and reducers are implemented to manage the state logic efficiently. Actions trigger state updates, while reducers specify how the application's state should change in response to those actions.
Functionality:

Add Task: Users can effortlessly add tasks to the list by inputting task details into a designated text field and pressing a button or hitting the Enter key. The application ensures a smooth and intuitive task addition process.
View Tasks: All added tasks are displayed in a structured list format, enabling users to view their tasks at a glance. The task list presentation enhances user experience and promotes task organization.
Delete Task: Each task in the list is equipped with a delete button. When clicked, the delete button removes the corresponding task from the list, allowing users to manage their tasks efficiently and declutter the interface.
